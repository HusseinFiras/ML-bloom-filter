# ML-Enhanced Bloom Filter

A machine learning-enhanced implementation of a Bloom Filter that improves traditional space-time tradeoffs for membership testing.

## Overview

This project implements a Bloom Filter variant that uses machine learning techniques to optimize the filter's performance. A Bloom Filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure used to test whether an element is a member of a set, with possible false positives but no false negatives.

## Features

- Traditional Bloom Filter implementation
- ML enhancement layer for improved accuracy
- Configurable false positive rate
- Space-efficient membership testing
- Support for dynamic set operations

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/husseinfiras/ml-bloom-filter.git
cd ml-bloom-filter
# Add any additional installation steps
